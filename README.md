# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description
- My task was to utilize MongoDB which database is a popular NoSQL for developers. I used MongoDB to make the backend of a Social Network API. The API can be used for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
- The application uses the packages Mongoose and Express.js were used which use Node.js to run.
- I built this application from scratch and it uses 100% Javascript.
